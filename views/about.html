            IndieWest started as a group of friends who wanted to make movies. Jenny,
            Albert, Kenny, and David met in high school in El Paso Texas. All of them 
            valued the history of El Paso, and many other Western towns. They bonded 
            over movies such as The Searchers, Stagecoach, and A Fistful of Dollars. All 
            of them went on to attend the University of Texas. There they found a unique
            combination of courses and opportunities that facilitated the creation of 
            IndieWest.

            We create photography and films that explore various themes of the human
            experience in the Western settings. We think Western movies aesthetics can
            be readapted to fit new settings. Weâ€™ve created The Blue Moon which follows 
            strange occurrences falling a blue moon in Summerset Oregon. We created
            Gold Chasers, the critically acclaimed indie film that has collected a cult 
            following. Read more from our blog to hear about what we are up to currently!
